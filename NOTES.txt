Seems to struggle with duplicate letters (RefreqyFlex2 doesn't deal with them very well)

# Other Strategies

## Maximum Discernment
When we have the list of words narrowed down, which letters would most help us discern from the remaining ones?
For example, if our possible words are: glare, blare, flare and we have xLARE, our best approach is not to try
the words serially, but to try a word with "g", "b", and "f" in it, e.g. "befog"
This is different from using frequency tables (I think).

## Double-letter aware frequency
Extend frequency data to have information on double/triple/etc. letters, and incorporate that into scoring.
