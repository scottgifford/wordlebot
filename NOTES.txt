You guessed 'hazer' in 7 guesses!
    Predecessor had double-letter - "razer"

Seems to struggle with duplicate letters (RefreqyFlex2 doesn't deal with them very well)

# Other Strategies

## Maximum Discernment
When we have the list of words narrowed down, which letters would most help us discern from the remaining ones?
For example, if our possible words are: glare, blare, flare and we have xLARE, our best approach is not to try
the words serially, but to try a word with "g", "b", and "f" in it, e.g. "befog"
This is different from using frequency tables (I think).

## Double-letter aware frequency
Extend frequency data to have information on double/triple/etc. letters, and incorporate that into scoring.
Maybe switch to RefreqyFlex2 v2 but filter out only single-letter choices instead of double-letter choices?

### Score

## Enhancement: Adjust letter tracker based on possibilities
Sometimes the limited number of possibilities let us infer things in the letter tracker, e.g. all of the possibilities
have a particular letter, sometimes in a particular position.

## Enhancement: In RefreqyFlex modes, take a real guess on the last guess
Instead of searching for words, if it's our last guess, might as well give it a shot.

## Enhancement: In RefreqyFlex modes, no score for a letter whose place we already know
Even if it could be a double letter, etc.

# Things to look into

## Deep-dive scoring
Make sure scoring is sensible and only values additional data
